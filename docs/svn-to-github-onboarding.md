# 🚀 Onboarding Guide: From SVN to GitHub

This guide is for users who are familiar with **SVN (Subversion)** and are moving to **GitHub**.  
It explains the equivalent commands, workflow changes, and best practices.

---

## 1. Install Git
1. Download and install Git: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
````

---

## 2. Configure Git (One-time setup)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

---

## 3. Create a GitHub Account

* Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
* Sign up or log in.

---

## 4. Create a Repository on GitHub

1. Click **New Repository** on GitHub.
2. Give it a name (example: `svn-to-github-poc`).
3. Copy the **HTTPS URL** of the repo.

---

## 5. Clone Repository (SVN checkout equivalent)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/svn-to-github-poc.git
cd svn-to-github-poc
```

---

## 6. Add Files (SVN add equivalent)

```bash
echo "Hello SVN users!" > hello.txt
git add hello.txt
```

---

## 7. Commit Files (SVN commit equivalent)

```bash
git commit -m "First commit from SVN to GitHub"
```

---

## 8. Push Changes to GitHub (send changes to central repo)

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## 9. Update Local Copy (SVN update equivalent)

```bash
git pull
```

---

## 10. Branching and Merging

* **Create a branch**:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-branch
  git push origin feature-branch
  ```
* **Merge changes**: Use **Pull Requests** on GitHub.

---

## 11. Common SVN vs Git Command Mapping

| SVN Command        | Git Equivalent                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `svn checkout URL` | `git clone URL`                  |
| `svn update`       | `git pull`                       |
| `svn add file`     | `git add file`                   |
| `svn commit -m ""` | `git commit -m ""`               |
| `svn log`          | `git log`                        |
| `svn diff`         | `git diff`                       |
| `svn branch`       | `git branch` / `git checkout -b` |
| `svn merge`        | `git merge`                      |

## 12. Best Practices for Migrated SVN Users

* Always `git pull` before `git push`.
* Write clear and meaningful commit messages.
* Use branches for new features or bug fixes.
* Perform reviews and merges via Pull Requests.
* Avoid committing directly to `main` unless necessary.

✅ With these steps, SVN users can smoothly transition to GitHub and follow modern Git workflows.

👉 You can copy this into `docs/svn-to-github-onboarding.md`.  
Do you also want me to create a **ready-to-paste PoC `README.md`** for your `poc/` folder so your manager sees both Documentation and Proof of Concept?
